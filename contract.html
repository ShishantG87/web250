        I,
        <a href="https://ShishantG87.github.io/intro.html">Shishant Bohora</a>,
        agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven Websites course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
      </p>
