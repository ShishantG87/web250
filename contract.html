          I,
          <a href="intro.html" id="contract-link">Shishant Bohora</a>, agree to
          abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven
          Websites course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen I understand that
          all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly
          available to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
          or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work
          that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As
          such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
